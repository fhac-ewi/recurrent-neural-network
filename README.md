# Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
This repository was created for `Machine Learning II - Data Learning (SS2021)` at FH Aachen.

It contains an exercise for text prediction based on a give lecture in `txt` format. In this exercise you ll build different models based on SimpleRNN, LSTM and GRU and try to optimize them.
